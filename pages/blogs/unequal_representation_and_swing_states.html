            <h2>What Are Swing States?</h2>
            <p>Swing states are states that change up consistently in the presidential election, these take the majority
                of the election focus—disregarding the states that are "safe states". Below is an image showcasing swing
                and safe states (albeit from 2008):</p>

            <h2>The Impact on Voters</h2>
            <p>This makes your vote vary in impact, if you are in a swing state—then your vote matters magnitudes more
                than a safe state. This is due to the fact that many people just mark down a political party every
                election regardless, espsecially in these safe states. This makes safe state votes less likely to change
                the outcome, while swing state votes very likely to change the outcome.</p>

            <p>This can cause many people to not vote due to their voice not being heard in the election, which is not
                what our democracy should promote.</p>
