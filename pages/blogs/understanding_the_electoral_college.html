            <h2>The Foundation</h2>
            <p>The electoral college is built on the ideas of the constitutional convention in 1787, and has not changed
                since—making this the most archaic system still left in our modern democracy. Other systems and
                governing ideologies had ways to change with the times, such as: ammendments to the constituion, and
                more.At its base form, each state is assigned an amount of electoral votes based on the representatives
                in house of representatives and senates, and a candidate needs 270 total to win the election. Below is a
                graph showcasing the electoral votes per state:</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering how electors are chosen, and this is through a closed system run by the state.
                This means that the electors are not choosen by the popular vote of the people but by the political
                giants and machines in the state government. This promotes internal corruption by the political parties.
            </p>

            <p>The electors also do not have to listen to the public, and have only an obligation to answer to the
                government officials who elected them. This provides a open way for faithless electors to go against
                their true vote. </p>
