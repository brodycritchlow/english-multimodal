            <h2>Direct Popular Vote</h2>
            <p>The Direct Popular Vote is a way to convert the true opinion of all people around the country into one
                result. The "popular vote" is a count of everyone who voted for one candidate, and vice versa. By using
                this system we get rid of the biases and faults in the Electoral College by listening to the end result
                of all peoples actions—the main fault this would remove is the opportunity to win the popular vote but
                lose the entire election in the electoral college. See a figure below showcasing this fact:</p>

            <p>This graph showcases the four occoruences of the fault said above, while this is a rare occassion (only
                roughly a 6% chance) this still does happen and would not be a problem within the direct popular vote
                system. Making sure that the American's voice is the result of their democratic representation—true
                democracy.</p>

            <h2>Ranked-Choice Voting</h2>
            <p>Ranked choive voting is more involved, but allows for a wider variety of voting. This system allows you
                to choose multiple candidates, for example in the 2024 election you could have choose this as your
                options, Donald Trump then Robert F. Kennedy then Joel Skousen as your last option. Then this would go
                through the rounds eliminating the voters who did not recieve enough percentage—distrubting your vote
                for that person to your next candidate. This goes on until a candidate has the majority, below is a true
                visualization of New York City DEM Mayor Citywide 2021 provided by <a

            <p>This visualization shows each round of elimination up until the point where Eric L. Adams won with 50.45%
                after 11 people were eliminated—or 12 including write-ins. This showcases the system in another part of
                our political system showcasing the easy expandability of it into our presidential election.</p>
